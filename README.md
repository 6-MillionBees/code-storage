### This is everything on my school computer (and and a bunch of other things)

What do I store in this repo?

- School work
- Personal projects
- Files I want synced across my devices

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have this repository copied across a couple devices to keep all my code up to date. This repo is not for any specific project and it only exsists to toss around code between a couple different computers of mine and to be a general storage soulution.

<br>

I have like 4 different computers this is synced across <br>
